---------------------------------
*(external) commands are those that are not hard-coded into the ljinux binary, but instead provided within /LjinuxRoot/bin

      /------------|
----<| Config.json |
      \------------|

The default config is:

{
"_comment1": "Default Ljinux configuration, adjust to your needs"

"_comment2": "As long as it's true, ram rtc will be used"
"fixrtc": true

"_comment3": "Display i2c pins"
"displaySCL": 17
"displaySDA": 16

"_comment4": "Display height - width"
"displayheight": 64
"displaywidth": 128

"_comment5": "Other display related options"
"_comment6": "Makes the pi only bother with sensor io & not serial. Not yet implemented"
"DISPLAYONLYMODE": false

"_comment7": "Debugging & extreme options"
"SKIPTEMP": false
"SKIPCP": false
"DEBUG": false

}

The config file is no longer mandatory, as the defaults are hardcoded in case they are missing / errored.

      /----------|
----<| Scripting |
      \----------|
      
Based script files need to have the .lja file extension. All internal or external commands can be used in scripts.
To have a script appear as a command, put it in /LjinuxRoot/bin/ or in the /bin of the sdcard.
To create a comment, simply write COMMENT in the beginning of the line.

To execute python code, you are advised to use pexec & fpexec.
The scope is the same as the one of ljinux and you can call & alter ljinux data freely. Security is not important when you don't have internet or usb.

      /---------------|
----<| Repo & Mirrors |
      \---------------|

The source & releases of Ljinux are primarily being made available to Github at: https://github.com/bill88t/ljinux
However it is also mirrored to my self-hosted Gitea instance at: https://git.port1.cf/bill88t/ljinux

      /-----------|
----<| Deployment |
      \-----------|

The bare minimum of files needed for ljinux to run is:
 - boot.py
 - code.py
 - ljinux.mpy

Without them Ljinux cannot function at all.
However it's highly recommended to have a root folder ("LjinuxRoot" or an sdcard) present.
