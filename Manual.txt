---------------------------------
*(external) commands are those that are not hard-coded into the ljinux binary, but instead provided within /LjinuxRoot/bin

      /------------|
----<| Config.json |
      \------------|

The default config is:

{
"_comment1": "Default Ljinux configuration, adjust to your needs"

"_comment2": "As long as it's true, ram rtc will be used"
"fixrtc": true

"_comment3": "Display i2c pins"
"displaySCL": 17
"displaySDA": 16

"_comment4": "Display height - width"
"displayheight": 64
"displaywidth": 128

"_comment5": "Other display related options"
"_comment6": "Makes the pi only bother with sensor io & not serial. Not yet implemented"
"DISPLAYONLYMODE": false

"_comment7": "Debugging & extreme options"
"SKIPTEMP": false
"SKIPCP": false
"DEBUG": false

}

The config file is no longer mandatory, as the defaults are hardcoded in case they are missing / errored.

      /----------|
----<| Scripting |
      \----------|
      
Based script files need to have the .lja file extension. All internal or external commands can be used in scripts.
To have a script appear as a command, put it in /LjinuxRoot/bin/ or in the /bin of the sdcard.
To create a comment, simply write COMMENT in the beginning of the line.

To execute python code, you are advised to use pexec & fpexec.
The scope is the same as the one of ljinux and you can call & alter ljinux data freely. Security is not important when you don't have internet or usb.

      /---------------|
----<| Repo & Mirrors |
      \---------------|

The source & releases of Ljinux are primarily being made available to Github at: https://github.com/bill88t/ljinux
However it is also mirrored to my self-hosted Gitea instance at: https://git.port1.cf/bill88t/ljinux

      /-----------|
----<| Deployment |
      \-----------|

The bare minimum of files needed for ljinux to run is:
 - boot.py
 - code.py
 - ljinux.mpy

Without them Ljinux cannot function at all.
However it's highly recommended to have a root folder ("LjinuxRoot" or an sdcard) present.

      /-------|
----<| Errors |
      \-------|

The differents errors used by the based shell.
CODE:
      ljinux.based.error([number])
      where [number] is one of the error below

1 : Syntax Error
      The command cannot work with the given arguments
      Read #basic-commands

2 : Input Error
      The input given is not understandable from the command

3 : Error
      This is a general error

4 : [file]: No such file or directory
      The file cannot be found

5 : Network unavailable
      The network interface is not functional

6 : Display not attached
      The display is not connected correctly

7 : Filesystem unwritable, pi in developer mode
      This error shows up when a write to the internal storage occures while developer mode is enabled. By CircuitPython design, when the internal storage is being made available from usb, it is unwritable to the os. To disable developer mode, delete the file "devm" from the root of LJINUX, and run the command "reboot"

8 : Missing files
      This error occurs when files needed for the command to run are missing.

9 : Missing arguments
      This error occur when the command is used without the necessary parameters.
